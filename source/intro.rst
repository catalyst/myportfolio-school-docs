What is MyPortfolio?
===========================

`MyPortfolio Schools <https://myportfolio.school.nz>`_ is a New Zealand wide ePortfolio service for schools offered by `Catalyst <https://catalyst.net.nz>`_. MyPortfolio brings together the benefits of leading education technology and social software in a safe education focused environment across school boundaries.

MyPortfolio is based on the open source ePortfolio system `Mahara <https://mahara.org>`_. Meaning 'think' or 'thought' in te reo MƒÅori, the name Mahara reflects the project's dedication to creating a user-centred lifelong learning and development environment underpinned by considerations of pedagogy and policy.

Who can use MyPortfolio?
----------------------------------------

MyPortfolio is available to schools for free in Aotearoa New Zealand. If your school is listed on the `Education counts web site <https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/find-school>`_, you can request to be signed up.

MyPortfolio is also open to certain support organisations and tertiary education departments in New Zealand that train future teachers or support teachers professionally. `Get in touch with us <https://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_ if you are unsure whether you can use MyPortfolio.

Does MyPortfolio need to be installed by my school?
------------------------------------------------------

MyPortfolio is not installed or maintained by a school's IT team. It is fully maintained by Catalyst, and schools access it via the internet. It can be integrated with school infrastructure for single sign-on authentication purposes and for connecting to a learning management system.

How do I get started?
-------------------------------

If you are not already using MyPortfolio, check if you can see your school in the drop-down menu on the `self-registration page <https://myportfolio.school.nz/register.php>`_.

.. note::
   Not all schools allow students and teachers to self-register. Your school may not be listed there. You can still sign up your school and use MyPortfolio.

If you cannot find it in the list of schools that allow self-registration, you can `sign it up <https://myportfolio.school.nz/registration.php>`_. Preferably, you will then be the administrator for your school on MyPortfolio. You can always nominate another teacher or staff for that role later.
