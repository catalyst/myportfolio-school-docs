Getting support
===========================

Is there a manual for MyPortfolio?
-----------------------------------------------

MyPortfolio is based on `Mahara <https://mahara.org>`_. The extensive `Mahara manual <https://manual.mahara.org/>`_ describes the functionalities that the software offers. It comes with screenshots and descriptions of what you can see on a screen.

You can access the Mahara manual from the footer of every page in MyPortfolio to receive help specifically for the page you are on.

In the Mahara manual, you can:

* Use the 'Quick search' on the left-hand side to find content easily.
* Browse through the table of contents. The topics are aligned according to the menu options.
* Refer to the index and browse to individual topics.

Can I ask others on MyPortfolio for help?
-------------------------------------------------------

On MyPortfolio, you can join the group `MyPortfolio Discussions <https://myportfolio.school.nz/group/myportfolio-discussions>`_ to ask questions of others - teachers, students, and administrators - to gain more knowledge on working with ePortfolios as well as MyPortfolio in particular.

Since MyPortfolio is available to all schools, you can learn from teachers from other schools.

Is there support staff I can contact?
--------------------------------------------

Please read through the :ref:`troubleshooting questions <troubleshooting>`, as many problems can be answered when you follow the steps outlined.

The administrators for a school on MyPortfolio are your first port of call for any direct queries. You can find out who they are when you go to your profile page (click on your name on the dashboard). You then see that you are a member of a school. Click the name of the school and you will be taken to a page where all administrators and staff for that school are listed.

If you have a question that is not answered in the :ref:`troubleshooting section <troubleshooting>` and your school administrator for MyPortfolio cannot help you, you can `contact the site support team <https://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_.

MyPortfolio support by the site support team is provided Monday through Friday (excluding public and Wellington holidays) between 9am and 5pm New Zealand time as quickly as possible.

How do I report a problem?
--------------------------------------

In order to assist you with an issue you are experiencing, it is important that we get as much information as possible on how you arrived at the problem:

#. Steps that you took to get to the problem, e.g. "I clicked the 'Edit' button for my page 'Learning portfolio'. On the next screen, I could not drag any of the blocks onto my page."
#. The browser and version of it. Usually, you can find that information when you click the 'Help' icon in your browser's menu bar and then 'About'.
#. The name and version of your operating system, e.g. Windows 10, Mac OS 10.10, Ubuntu 18.10.
#. If your problem is best illustrated by a screenshot or a short screen recording, please include that. You can also draw on it and point out the issue. If you are sending a screenshot, please send your issue report to `support@myportfolio.school.nz <mailto:support@myportfolio.school.nz>`_ as the online form does not allow you to upload a file.

Please include the phone number under which you can be reached in case it is necessary to discuss any details that are better asked over the phone.
