What is MyPortfolio?
===========================

My Portfolio is a nationwide ePortfolio service for schools offered by the `New Zealand Ministry of Education <http://minedu.govt.nz/>`_ managed and supported by `Catalyst IT <http://catalyst.net.nz/>`_. New Zealand schools are welcome to use MyPortfolio. The key benefit of a learner driven environment being on a shared "software as a service" environment is that sector wide learner communities may flourish. MyPortfolio brings together the benefits of leading education technology and social software in a safe education focused environment.

MyPortfolio is based on the open source ePortfolio system `Mahara <https://mahara.org>`_. Meaning 'think' or 'thought' in Te Reo MƒÅori, the name Mahara reflects the project's dedication to creating a user-centred life-long learning and development application underpinned by considerations of pedagogy and policy.

Does MyPortfolio need to be installed by a school?
------------------------------------------------------

MyPortfolio is not installed or maintained by a school's IT team. Instead, it is a single Mahara instance available to New Zealand schools to connect to. It can be integrated with school infrastructure for authentication purposes and also transfer of content if `Moodle <http://moodle.org>`_ is the learning management system.

How do I get started?
-------------------------------

If you are not yet using MyPortfolio, check with your school if it is already registered. If you cannot find it in the list of schools that allow self-registration during sign-up, please check with someone at your school, e.g. the principal, the IT department, a learning technologies teacher. A number of schools turned off self-registration as they allow their students and teachers to use single sign-on or another way of logging in.

If your school is not yet registered, it can be `signed up <http://myportfolio.school.nz/registration.php>`_. This should be done by the principal of the school or a school representative who will then also be the administrator for your school on MyPortfolio.
