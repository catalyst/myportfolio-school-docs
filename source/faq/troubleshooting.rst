Troubleshooting MyPortfolio
=================================

I forgot my password. How can I get into MyPortfolio?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Usually, you can click the `"Lost username/password" <http://myportfolio.school.nz/forgotpass.php>`_ link on the homepage of MyPortfolio. Enter your username, or if you do not know that, your email address, and you will receive an email with further instructions.

If you normally log in to MyPortfolio through Moodle, go to your Moodle site and log in through there.

If your school has single sign-on and you forgot your login information, please contact your school's IT team so they can reset your password.

If you still cannot get in, please ask your school administrator for MyPortfolio for assistance. You can contact them via your school's page:

#. Click your name on the dashboard.
#. Click your school's name on your profile page.
#. All administrators for your school are listed.

My page is not accessible to others
--------------------------------------------

Check that you have set any access permissions for the page or collection that you want to share. Go to *Portfolio â†’ Shared by me* and click the *Edit access* icon next to the page or collection that you want to share. Make sure that the person you want to share your portfolio with is listed on the right under "Added".

See the user manual for more information on `how to give someone access to your portfolio <http://manual.mahara.org/en/1.10/portfolio/share.html>`_.

Some of the functions in MyPortfolio don't work
--------------------------------------------------------

Javascript needs to be turned on for MyPortfolio to work. If you turned it off in your browser, please activate it again.

If the problems continue, please let us know in the "Bug, Issues and Problems" forum in the `MyPortfolio Discussions group <http://myportfolio.school.nz/group/myportfolio-discussions>`_ or if it is urgent, `contact us <http://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_.

There is an error message
-------------------------------------

Does the error message contain information about the issue and / or how to fix it? If so, please fix the problem.

If it is a generic error message such as "You encountered a bug in the system":

#. Log out of MyPortfolio.
#. Log back in to MyPortfolio.
#. Try to follow the steps again and see if the error message comes up again.

   * If it doesn't, continue with your work.
   * If it does, `contact us <http://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_ with details about the steps you took to get to the error, and we will analyse the problem further.

The video I uploaded is not displayed in the "Internal media" block
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following video formats can be embedded within MyPortfolio. Some may require that your computer can display them:

* AVI (requires a plugin on non-Windows computers)
* FLV (flash)
* MP4 (encoded in H.264)
* MPEG movie
* QuickTime
* SWF (flash)
* WMV (requires a plugin on non-Windows computers)

In addition, MP3 files can be used in the "Internal media" block as well and played directly in MyPortfolio.

I don't like the design thas is applied to my portfolio pages. How do I change it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. If you want to change only your portfolio, you can `create a skin <http://manual.mahara.org/en/1.10/portfolio/skins.html>`_ and apply that on top of the current theme overwriting its styles.

   .. note::
     You may need to ask your institution administrator to allow skins for your school if you do not see the **Skins** menu item under **Portfolio**.

#. If you don't want your school to use the default theme, you can ask your school's administrator on MyPortfolio to choose a different built-in theme which would then be used by everyone in your school. If skins are allowed, you can also overwrite these styles for more flexibility in the look of your portfolio.

Who is administrator on MyPortfolio for my school?
----------------------------------------------------------

Administrators as well as an institution's staff are listed on a special page so you can contact them easily.

#. Click on your name in the top right of the screen or in the login box. You'll be taken to your profile page.
#. On your profile page, you see "Member of...". Click the link to your institution. On the next page...
#. You see all administrators and staff members listed for your institution.

.. note::
   If your school does not have an administrator listed, nobody would respond to your administration queries. You can `contact the site administration team <http://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_ if you need assistance from an administrator.
