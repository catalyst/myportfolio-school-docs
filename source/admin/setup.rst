Set up your school on MyPortfolio
-----------------------------------------------------

Congratulations on wanting to use MyPortfolio. Here you can find more information on setting up your school.

MyPortfolio is available to schools for free in Aotearoa New Zealand. If your school is listed on the `Education counts web site <https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/find-school>`_, you can request to be signed up.

Register your school
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your school is not yet registered on MyPortfolio, you can register it within a couple of minutes: Fill in the `registration form <https://myportfolio.school.nz/registration.php>`_ and send it.

.. note::
   Please register with your official school email address rather than a personal one. That will speed up the registration process.

A site administrator will review your request as soon as possible and will be in touch within a New Zealand business day.

.. warning::
   If you haven't received a reply, please check your spam folder. You should allow mails from **support@myportfolio.school.nz**. A reply to any of your queries sent to this email address comes from **MyPortfolio Schools via RT**.

You will receive the following from the support team:

#. Email confirming the registration of your school.
#. Your account details so you can start working with MyPortfolio.

  .. note::
    The person who registers a school becomes the administrator for that school automatically. They can appoint alternative or additional administrators. If your school is already registered, it may already have an administrator with whom you can discucss further administrator tasks.

#. Invitation to the support group **MyPortfolio Discussions**. You can connect with other educators and ask questions, both pedagogical and technical.

Once your school is set up on MyPortfolio, you can start using it straight away with your students and other teachers.

Set up accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have several options for creating accounts for your students and teachers. The following are the main options available:

#. **Manual account creation**: Set up accounts one at a time. This is good if you only set up one account every few days. Otherwise, use the bulk account creation. Check the Mahara manual for more information on how to `create individual accounts <https://manual.mahara.org/en/19.10/administration/users.html#add-user>`_.
#. **Bulk account creation**: If you need to set up several accounts at once and don't use an external authentication method, create accounts via a CSV file. Check the Mahara manual for more information on how to `create accounts in bulk <https://manual.mahara.org/en/19.10/administration/users.html#add-and-update-users-by-csv>`_.

  .. note::
     An email address is required for all accounts. If your students do not have email addresses, please get in touch with the `MyPortfolio support team <https://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_.

#. **Single sign-on** (via SAML): If you use single sign-on (SSO) at your school, you can enable your students and teachers to use their regular logins also for MyPortfolio. Check the Mahara manual for the details that the site administrator would need from you in order to `set up SSO <https://manual.mahara.org/en/19.10/administration/institutions.html#saml-authentication>`_.
#. **LDAP / Active Directory**: If you have your students and teachers in LDAP / Active Directory, this can be hooked into MyPortfolio. Check the Mahara manual for the details that the site administrator would need from you in order to `set up LDAP / Active Directory <https://manual.mahara.org/en/19.10/administration/institutions.html#ldap-authentication>`_.
#. **Learning management system**: If you use a learning management system (LMS), e.g. Moodle or Canvas, you can `set up LTI <https://manual.mahara.org/en/19.10/external/externalapps.html>`_ in order to log in to MyPortfolio. This allows you to:

   * Log in to MyPortfolio via your LMS.
   * Set up assignments in your LMS and ask students to submit portfolios to them.

.. note::
   You can't set up the connection to SSO, LDAP, Active Directory, or your LMS on your own. Please contact the `MyPortfolio support team <https://myportfolio.school.nz/contact.php>`_ to assist you with that because only site administrators can add external authentication methods.
